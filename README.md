# simulation
Extending the Tickers object of the yfinance package, I aim to create a ready-to-use portfolio simulation tool. 

## Status
Have set up simulation, reweighting, and reinvestment logic. Currently expanding reweighting strategies to test Fama & French asset valuation techniques.

## TODO:
- Import constrained portfolio optimisation techniques from former project.
- Package Fama & French method in one ready-to-use function.
